The objective of a house property price data science project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features. Here are specific objectives related to the features of the house:<br/>
**1-	Feature Importance Analysis:**<br/>
Identify and rank the importance of different features in influencing the house price. This helps in understanding which characteristics have the most significant impact.<br/>
**2-	Feature Engineering:**<br/>
Explore and create new features that might better capture the underlying patterns in the data, improving the model's predictive performance.<br/>
**3-	Addressing Missing Values:**<br/>
Develop strategies for handling missing values in the dataset, such as imputation or exclusion of instances with missing data.<br/>
